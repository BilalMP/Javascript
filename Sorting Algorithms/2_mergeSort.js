/*
Write a JavaScript program to sort a list of elements using Merge sort.

According to Wikipedia "Merge sort (also commonly spelled mergesort) is an O (n log n) comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output."

Algorithm:

Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows :

Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted).
Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.

const mergeSort = (arr) => {
    if (arr.length <= 1) return arr;

    const mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);
    const left = mergeSort(arr.slice(0, mid));
    const right = mergeSort(arr.slice(mid));

    return merge(left, right);
};

const merge = (left, right) => {
    const result = [];
    let i = 0,
        j = 0;

    while (i < left.length && j < right.length) {
        if (left[i] < right[j]) result.push(left[i++]);
        else result.push(right[j++]);
    }

    return [...result, ...left.slice(i), ...right.slice(j)];
};

console.log(mergeSort([34, 7, 23, 32, 5, 62]));
